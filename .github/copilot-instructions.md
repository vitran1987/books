# File Creation/Update Instructions

## Incremental File Operations (MANDATORY)

1. **Create empty file first** - Use `create_file` with minimal content (header/comment only)
2. **Update in 50-line chunks** - Use `replace_string_in_file` to add max 50 lines per increment
3. **Think between increments** - Validate, plan next section, then continue
4. **Never create/update large files at once** - Always break into 50-line sections
