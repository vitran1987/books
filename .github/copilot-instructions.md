# File Creation/Update Instructions

## Incremental File Operations (MANDATORY)

1. **Create empty file first** - Use `create_file` with minimal content (header/comment only)
2. **Update in 50-line chunks** - Use `replace_string_in_file` to add max 50 lines per increment
3. **Think between increments** - Validate, plan next section, then continue
4. **Never create/update large files at once** - Always break into 50-line sections

# Book Writing Instructions

## Writing Style (MANDATORY)

1. **Pure Vietnamese language** - Write ONLY in Vietnamese, no mixing English and Vietnamese in the same content
2. **Long paragraphs with narrative flow** - Use story-based writing, NOT bullet points or short disconnected sentences
3. **Real-life examples required** - Include verified case studies with specific companies, dates, and business metrics
4. **Trusted sources mandatory** - Support all claims with facts, numbers, and statistics from credible sources
5. **Business + Technical balance** - Lead with business value, support with technical details
6. **Conversational tone** - Write as if speaking to a knowledgeable colleague, friendly and accessible
7. **Subsection structure** - Each chapter must have 5-8 subsections, each in separate file (never single-file chapters)
8. **EPUB-ready formatting** - Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) for table of contents generation

## Content Requirements

- Open each section with engaging story/scenario
- Include minimum 2-3 detailed case studies per chapter with verified metrics
- Cite all statistics and data with sources
- Provide actionable business implementation guidance
- Maintain narrative flow between sections (no lists of disconnected points)

## Opening Pattern Rules (CRITICAL - NO EXCEPTIONS)

**NEVER use repetitive time-based opening patterns such as:**
- ❌ "Vào một buổi sáng/chiều/tối... ngày tháng năm, một người nào đó đang làm gì đó..."
- ❌ "Vào ngày X tháng Y năm Z, [person] đã..."
- ❌ "Vào tháng X năm Y, khi [situation]..."
- ❌ Any variation starting with time/date markers followed by character introduction

**ALWAYS use varied, engaging openings that emphasize:**
- ✅ Character's emotional state, decision, or unusual situation (lead with the person/action)
- ✅ Extraordinary nature of event or outcome (lead with impact/drama)
- ✅ Crisis, tension, or conflict (lead with the problem)
- ✅ Surprising statistics or achievements (lead with numbers)
- ✅ Questions, doubts, or controversy (lead with uncertainty)
- ✅ Immediate action in progress (drop readers into ongoing situation)
- ✅ Revolutionary impact or transformation (lead with change)

**Examples of GOOD openings:**
- "Giao dịch phi thường xuất hiện trên mạng Ethereum khiến cả cộng đồng tài chính choáng váng..."
- "Michael Chen cảm thấy lo lắng khi đặt 50 ETH vào ICO DeepVault..."
- "Cuộc tấn công tinh vi nhất lịch sử DeFi vừa diễn ra..."
- "Hàng nghìn người đồng loạt theo dõi livestream với hồi hộp nghẹt thở..."
- "Blur marketplace phá vỡ thị trường NFT bằng cách biến royalties thành tùy chọn..."
- "Thị trường NFT vẫn chỉ là góc nhỏ niche đầu 2021, rồi bùng nổ thành hiện tượng toàn cầu..."

**If time/date context is needed:**
- Place it AFTER the engaging opening hook
- Weave it naturally into the second or third sentence
- Use as supporting context, not as the primary opening element

## Quality Standards

- All claims verified and sourced
- Active voice, clear explanations
- Concrete examples with business perspectives
- Smooth transitions between subsections

## Reference Writing Style (MANDATORY)

**Study and emulate the writing style from:**
- `blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

**Key characteristics to replicate:**
- **Long narrative paragraphs** - Each subsection contains multiple paragraphs of 150-300 words that flow naturally
- **Story-driven openings** - Start with compelling characters, situations, or drama (NOT time-based patterns)
- **Detailed case studies** - Include specific names, dates, dollar amounts, and verifiable metrics
- **Business context first** - Lead with "why this matters" before diving into technical details
- **Smooth transitions** - Connect ideas between paragraphs using transition phrases
- **Conversational yet authoritative** - Professional but accessible tone, as if explaining to a colleague
- **Statistics integration** - Weave data and numbers naturally into narrative, with context
- **Multiple perspectives** - Show both successes and failures, lessons from both
- **Actionable insights** - End major sections with clear takeaways and implications

**Pattern to follow from sample:**
1. Open with engaging hook (character in situation, dramatic moment, or surprising fact)
2. Expand with background context and significance
3. Present detailed evidence (case studies, data, examples)
4. Analyze implications and lessons learned
5. Connect to broader themes or next section
