## General Guidelines for Part II

### Writing Style Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Pure Vietnamese**: No English/Vietnamese mixing in main content
- **Long narrative paragraphs**: Tell stories of these education systems
- **Engaging openings**: Character-driven or impact-driven (NOT time-based)
- **International + Vietnamese context**: Show how these apply to Vietnam
- **Evidence-based**: Every claim about "what works" needs data
- **Balanced perspective**: Discuss conditions where alternatives DON'T work
- **Reference style**: Emulate `blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

### Opening Pattern Examples (GOOD)
✅ "Hệ thống giáo dục Phần Lan gây choáng váng thế giới khi công bố học sinh chỉ học 20 giờ mỗi tuần nhưng đứng đầu bảng xếp hạng PISA..."
✅ "Maria Montessori đã khám phá ra điều gì mà 110 năm sau, hàng nghìn trường học trên thế giới vẫn áp dụng phương pháp của bà?"
✅ "Bộ não con người có một bí mật mà hệ thống giáo dục đã bỏ qua suốt 200 năm..."

### Research Source Priority
1. **Official education data**: Ministry reports, PISA, TIMSS
2. **Peer-reviewed neuroscience**: Published studies in reputable journals
3. **Longitudinal studies**: Long-term tracking of alternative education outcomes
4. **Meta-analyses**: Reviews of multiple studies, not single papers
5. **Expert books**: Daniel Coyle, Carol Dweck, Anders Ericsson (cite properly)
6. **Vietnamese adaptations**: How these apply in Vietnam context

### Key Questions to Answer in Part II

**For Chapter 4 (Alternatives That Work)**:
1. What exactly do these systems do differently?
2. What evidence shows they work (or don't)?
3. What conditions are required for success?
4. What types of children thrive (or struggle) in each?
5. How could Vietnamese families access or adapt these?
6. What are the costs (financial, time, social)?
7. What are the risks and failure modes?

**For Chapter 5 (Neuroscience)**:
1. What does brain science say about how we learn?
2. How does traditional schooling violate these principles?
3. How can parents apply neuroscience at home?
4. What are age-appropriate expectations?
5. How does AI align with or enhance brain-based learning?
6. What's the difference between pop psychology and real research?
7. What uncertainties remain in the science?

### Deliverables for Part II
- 14 subsection files (7 per chapter × 2 chapters)
- Each file: 800-1200 words, Vietnamese, narrative style
- All neuroscience claims accurately sourced
- Minimum 8 detailed case studies across 2 chapters (alternative schools + learners)
- Practical application sections in each subsection
- Chapter-end resources: books, websites, contacts for alternative schools

### Timeline Estimate
- Research Phase: 3 weeks per chapter (more intensive for neuroscience)
- Writing Phase: 1 week per subsection (7 weeks per chapter)
- Review Phase: 1 week per chapter (extra scrutiny for scientific accuracy)
- **Total Part II**: Approximately 11-12 weeks

### Success Criteria
✅ Readers understand alternative education isn't "fringe" but evidence-based
✅ Neuroscience is accurate but accessible (no jargon)
✅ Clear on what works, for whom, under what conditions
✅ Readers can evaluate if alternatives fit their family
✅ Practical: readers know how to find/access these alternatives
✅ Honest about limitations and failures
✅ Vietnamese context integrated throughout

### Special Considerations

**For Alternative Education Section**:
- Avoid romanticizing alternatives - show trade-offs
- Be specific about costs and requirements
- Address social development concerns head-on
- Provide Vietnam-specific resources where possible
- Include stories of families who tried and switched back

**For Neuroscience Section**:
- Distinguish real research from self-help pop psychology
- Cite original studies, not popularizations
- Explain WHY the brain works this way (evolution, survival)
- Show implications for daily learning activities
- Connect to AI tools that leverage these principles
- Address individual differences (not all brains are the same)
