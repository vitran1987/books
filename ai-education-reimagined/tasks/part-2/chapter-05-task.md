## Success Criteria

Chapter 5 succeeds if:
✅ Neuroscience is accurate but accessible to non-scientists
✅ Parents understand HOW brain science supports personalized learning
✅ Connection clear between brain science and Chapter 4 alternatives
✅ Practical implications explicit (what parents should do)
✅ Avoids pop neuroscience oversimplification
✅ Readers feel informed and empowered
✅ Natural bridge to Part III (new framework based on science)

Chapter 5 fails if:
❌ Too technical (parents can't understand)
❌ Pop neuroscience myths promoted without nuance
❌ Overpromising what neuroscience proves
❌ No clear connection to practical education decisions
❌ Confusing brain science with definitive prescriptions
❌ Ignoring individual differences and complexity
❌ Academic tone alienates general readers

**CRITICAL NOTES**:

1. **Avoid Pop Neuroscience**: Don't oversimplify. Growth mindset isn't magic. Learning styles are debunked. Neuroplasticity has limits.

2. **Original Research, Not Popularizations**: Cite Dweck's actual studies, not blog summaries. Ericsson's research, not Gladwell's interpretation.

3. **Accessible Science**: Use analogies. Explain technical terms. Show through stories.

4. **Practical Bridge**: Every neuroscience concept must connect to what parents can do.

5. **Honest About Limits**: Acknowledge what neuroscience doesn't yet know. Don't overpromise.

---

**Expert Review**: Consider having neuroscientist or cognitive psychologist review for accuracy before finalizing.
