## Success Criteria

Chapter 4 succeeds if:
✅ Readers understand alternatives aren't fringe - they have evidence
✅ Multiple models presented with research backing each
✅ Balanced: success stories AND failure cases
✅ Clear on conditions needed for each model to work
✅ Vietnamese parents can evaluate fit for their family
✅ International examples made accessible and relevant
✅ Transition to neuroscience explanation (Chapter 5) natural

Chapter 4 fails if:
❌ Romanticizing alternatives without addressing challenges
❌ Cherry-picking data to support predetermined conclusion
❌ Ignoring students/families for whom alternatives don't work
❌ Too focused on Western models without Vietnamese context
❌ Academic tone alienates general readers
❌ No practical framework for parents to evaluate options

---

**CRITICAL**: Balance is essential. Show both successes and appropriate use cases. Not all children thrive in alternatives.
