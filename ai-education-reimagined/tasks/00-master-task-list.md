## Writing Standards (CRITICAL)

### Language Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
✅ **Pure Vietnamese**: NO mixing English and Vietnamese in same content
✅ **Long narrative paragraphs**: Story-based, NOT bullet points
✅ **Engaging openings**: NO time-based patterns ("Vào một buổi sáng...")
✅ **Real case studies**: Specific names, dates, companies, verified metrics
✅ **Conversational tone**: Like talking to colleague over coffee
✅ **Data integration**: Weave statistics naturally into narrative

### Reference Writing Style
**MUST emulate**: `blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

**Key characteristics**:
- Long narrative paragraphs (150-300 words each)
- Story-driven openings (character/situation/drama, NOT time-based)
- Detailed case studies with specific metrics
- Business context before technical details
- Smooth transitions between paragraphs
- Conversational yet authoritative
- Statistics integrated naturally
- Multiple perspectives (success AND failure)
- Actionable insights at major section ends

## Critical Success Factors

### The Book Succeeds If:

1. **Educational value**: Readers learn something genuinely new backed by research
2. **Decision support**: Parents can make informed choice about child's education
3. **Actionability**: Specific plans can be implemented immediately
4. **Intellectual honesty**: Doesn't oversell or hide problems
5. **Balanced perspective**: Presents as one option, not only option
6. **Research grounding**: Every major claim supported by evidence
7. **Practical wisdom**: Combines research with real-world experience
8. **Long-term value**: Still relevant and useful in 5+ years

### The Book Fails If:

❌ Readers inspired but don't know what to do
❌ Claims not supported by credible evidence
❌ Ignores risks or failure modes
❌ One-size-fits-all prescriptive approach
❌ Academic language alienates general readers
❌ Western-centric without Vietnamese context
❌ Vague inspiration without specific tools/steps

## Risk Management

### Potential Challenges

1. **Research Access**: Some international studies may be behind paywalls
   - Mitigation: Use university library access, contact researchers directly

2. **Interview Recruitment**: Finding Vietnamese families doing alternative education
   - Mitigation: Start recruitment early, use Facebook groups, homeschool networks

3. **AI Tool Evolution**: Tools mentioned may change/disappear
   - Mitigation: Focus on principles, include update mechanism in book

4. **Legal Complexity**: Homeschooling regulations vary and change
   - Mitigation: Include disclaimer, provide general framework, recommend legal consultation

5. **Time Management**: 15-17 months is ambitious
   - Mitigation: Prioritize chapters, allow flexibility in timeline

6. **Case Study Verification**: Ensuring case studies are authentic
   - Mitigation: Direct interviews, request permission, verify details
