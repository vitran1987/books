- **Pure Vietnamese**: No English/Vietnamese mixing
- **Career-focused narrative**: Show clear path from learning to employment/business
- **Real case studies**: Minimum 2 detailed cases per chapter with verified outcomes
- **Tool specificity**: Name actual tools, platforms, costs
- **Practical curriculum**: Step-by-step learning path for each domain
- **Risk honesty**: Discuss career risks and failure rates
- **Reference style**: Emulate `blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

### Opening Pattern Examples (GOOD)
✅ "Kênh YouTube của Minh đạt 1 triệu lượt xem trong tháng đầu. Bạn bè cùng lớp vẫn đang học đạo hàm..."

- Note cost (free, subscription, one-time)
- Describe learning curve
- Show actual output examples
- Mention alternatives
- Include safety/privacy concerns
- Note Vietnamese accessibility (some tools region-locked)
