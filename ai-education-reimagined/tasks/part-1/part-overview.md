## General Guidelines for Part I

### Writing Style Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Pure Vietnamese**: Write ONLY in Vietnamese, no English/Vietnamese mixing
- **Long narrative paragraphs**: Story-based, NOT bullet points
- **Engaging openings**: NO time-based patterns ("Vào một buổi sáng...")
- **Real case studies**: Specific names, dates, companies, verified metrics
- **Conversational tone**: Like talking to a colleague over coffee
- **Data integration**: Weave statistics naturally into narrative
- **Reference style**: Emulate `blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

### Opening Pattern Examples (GOOD)
✅ "Giao dịch phi thường xuất hiện trên LinkedIn khiến cả ngành tuyển dụng choáng váng..."
✅ "Câu hỏi khiến hàng nghìn phụ huynh mất ngủ: Con tôi vừa tốt nghiệp đại học nhưng không tìm được việc..."
✅ "Thống kê từ Bộ Lao động Việt Nam năm 2024 gây sốc..."

### Research Source Priority
1. **Official data**: Government statistics, UNESCO, OECD
2. **Reputable research**: McKinsey, World Economic Forum, academic journals
3. **Vietnamese context**: Local data from Vietnam ministries and studies
4. **International comparison**: PISA, TIMSS, other global assessments
5. **First-hand cases**: Interviews, surveys, real stories with permission

### Deliverables for Part I
- 21 subsection files (7 per chapter × 3 chapters)
- Each file: 800-1200 words, Vietnamese, narrative style
- All statistics sourced and integrated naturally
- Minimum 6 detailed case studies across 3 chapters
- Chapter-end "Further Reading" sections with sources

### Timeline Estimate
- Research Phase: 2-3 weeks per chapter
- Writing Phase: 1 week per subsection (7 weeks per chapter)
- Review Phase: 1 week per chapter
- **Total Part I**: Approximately 10-12 weeks

### Success Criteria
✅ Every major claim supported by credible data
✅ Accessible to 10th grader while intellectually rigorous
✅ Vietnamese parents feel understood and informed
✅ Balanced critique without being preachy
✅ Practical insights, not just complaints
✅ Smooth narrative flow, not disconnected sections
