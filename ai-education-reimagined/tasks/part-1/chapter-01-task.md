## Success Criteria

Chapter 1 succeeds if:
✅ Readers understand education-employment mismatch is DATA-backed, not opinion
✅ Vietnamese parents see their reality reflected in stories
✅ Statistics are compelling and credible
✅ Not just complaining - sets up for solutions in later chapters
✅ Engaging enough that readers want to continue to Chapter 2
✅ Writing style matches reference chapter

Chapter 1 fails if:
❌ Vague complaints without specific data
❌ Academic or preachy tone
❌ No Vietnamese context
❌ Statistics feel cherry-picked or unreliable
❌ Readers feel depressed without hope
❌ Disconnected subsections that don't build argument
