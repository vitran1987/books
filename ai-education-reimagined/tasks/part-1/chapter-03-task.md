This is the cornerstone research for this chapter.

**Survey design**:
- [ ] Target: 1,000 professionals across industries
- [ ] Questions:

  2. Current occupation
  3. List subjects studied in school (high school + university)
  4. Rate usage frequency of each subject (1-5 scale)
  5. Which subjects actually used in career?
  6. Which subjects wish you'd learned instead?
  7. Biggest gap between education and job requirements?
  8. Open response: Most useless thing you were forced to learn?

**Distribution strategy**:
- [ ] LinkedIn survey (share in professional groups)
- [ ] Vietnamese Facebook professional groups
- [ ] Email to alumni networks
- [ ] Partner with HR departments for employee surveys
- [ ] Google Forms in Vietnamese

**Action items**:

## Success Criteria

Chapter 3 succeeds if:
✅ Survey data is credible and compelling (1,000+ responses)
✅ Challenges "well-rounded education" with evidence, not opinion
✅ Cognitive science explained accessibly
✅ International comparison shows alternatives exist
✅ Readers question their assumptions about curriculum
✅ Constructive critique, not just complaining

Chapter 3 fails if:
❌ Survey is small or biased
❌ Dismissing all general education (too extreme)
❌ Cognitive science too technical or poorly explained
❌ Seems like opinion piece, not research-based
❌ No practical alternative suggested
❌ Readers defensive about traditional education

---

**CRITICAL**: The survey is essential. Start immediately and aim for 1,000+ responses for credibility.
