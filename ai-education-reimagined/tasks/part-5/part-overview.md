## General Guidelines for Part V

### Writing Style Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Pure Vietnamese**: No English/Vietnamese mixing
- **Implementation-focused**: Every section must be actionable
- **Honest about challenges**: Don't sugarcoat the difficulties
- **Specific and detailed**: Exact steps, costs, timelines
- **Emotionally supportive**: Address fears and doubts
- **Future-oriented**: Help readers see long-term vision
- **Reference style**: Emulate `blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

### Opening Pattern Examples (GOOD)
✅ "Buổi họp gia đình kéo dài ba giờ. Bà ngoại khóc. Ông ngoại nổi giận. Nhưng quyết định cuối cùng của gia đình Nguyễn thay đổi cuộc đời cháu Minh..."
✅ "Chi phí thực tế cho giáo dục tại nhà không phải con số bạn nghĩ. Đây là bảng chi tiết từ 10 gia đình Việt Nam..."
✅ "Năm 2045, những đứa trẻ học với AI từ năm 2025 sẽ 30 tuổi. Cuộc sống của chúng sẽ khác biệt thế nào?"

### Research Source Priority
1. **Real family experiences**: First-hand interviews (critical for credibility)
2. **Legal documents**: Official government regulations
3. **Financial data**: Actual costs from families doing this
4. **Longitudinal studies**: Long-term outcomes of alternative education

### Final Implementation Notes

**Part V is the "make or break" section**:
- If readers reach Part V inspired but not knowing what to do → book fails
- If readers reach Part V and can start Monday → book succeeds

**Every section must answer**: "What exactly do I do?"
**Every concern must be addressed**: "But what about...?"
**Every risk must be acknowledged**: "What if this goes wrong?"

**This is where trust is built or lost**:
- Vague advice → readers feel abandoned
- Honest challenges + solutions → readers feel supported
- Practical tools → readers feel empowered
