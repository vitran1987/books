## Success Criteria

Chapter 6 succeeds if:
✅ Framework is clear but adaptable to different children
✅ Parents understand how to personalize for their child
✅ Research backing for specialization decisions provided
✅ Multiple path examples show framework in action
✅ Assessment alternatives are practical and credible
✅ Readers feel empowered, not overwhelmed
✅ Smooth bridge to Chapter 7 (AI tools for implementation)

Chapter 6 fails if:
❌ Framework feels rigid or one-size-fits-all
❌ Too theoretical without practical examples
❌ Parents don't know how to adapt to their child
❌ Oversimplifying complex career development research
❌ Assessment alternatives seem impractical
❌ No clear next steps for readers
