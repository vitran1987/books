## General Guidelines for Part III

### Writing Style Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Pure Vietnamese**: No English/Vietnamese mixing
- **Long narrative paragraphs**: Explain framework through stories
- **Engaging openings**: Problem-focused or discovery-focused
- **Practical examples**: Show framework in action with real scenarios
- **Tool-specific guidance**: Name actual tools, show actual usage
- **Safety-first approach**: Address concerns proactively
- **Reference style**: Emulate `blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

### Opening Pattern Examples (GOOD)
✅ "Sarah, 12 tuổi, đam mê cả vẽ tranh lẫn lập trình. Hệ thống truyền thống bắt cô bé chọn một. Nhưng nếu có cách học cả hai?"
✅ "Công cụ AI vừa trả lời sai câu hỏi của con bạn. Đây là khoảnh khắc quan trọng nhất trong giáo dục thời AI..."
✅ "Những bậc cha mẹ lo lắng nhất thường là những người bảo vệ con tốt nhất. Câu hỏi không phải 'có nên dùng AI không' mà là 'dùng thế nào cho an toàn'..."

### Research Source Priority
1. **Framework research**: Competency-based education, personalized learning studies
2. **AI education research**: MIT, Stanford, academic AI literacy programs
3. **Safety research**: COPPA, GDPR guidelines, child safety organizations
4. **Tool evaluation**: Test tools personally, not just review marketing
5. **Real case studies**: Interview families using these approaches
6. **Ethical frameworks**: UNESCO, EU AI guidelines adapted for children

### Key Questions to Answer in Part III

**For Chapter 6 (Framework)**:
1. How flexible is the 5-5-4-2 model?
2. What core skills does EVERY child need?
3. When should specialization begin?
4. How to design paths for multi-talented children?
5. What if child wants to change direction?
6. How to assess learning without traditional tests?
7. What's the minimum viable framework?

**For Chapter 7 (AI as Partner)**:
1. What AI tools are appropriate for what ages?
2. How to teach AI literacy before using tools?
3. What's the progression from simple to advanced?
4. How to prevent AI dependency?
5. How to measure real learning (not just AI output)?
6. What projects demonstrate competence?
7. When is AI use appropriate vs inappropriate?

**For Chapter 8 (Safety & Ethics)**:
1. What are the REAL risks (not hypothetical fears)?
2. How to set age-appropriate boundaries?
3. What technical tools provide protection?
4. How to teach children to verify AI output?
5. What ethical principles guide AI use?
6. How much parental oversight is needed?
7. What are red flags requiring intervention?
