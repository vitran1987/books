## Work Phases

### Phase 1: Research (Current Priority)
**What to do**: Gather all data, studies, and sources for Part I (Chapters 1-3)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks per chapter
**Output**: Research database with all sources documented

**Key research areas for Chapter 1**:
- Education-employment mismatch data
- Skills gap research
- Student debt statistics
- Vietnam-specific case studies
- Graduate employment outcomes

### Phase 2: Writing
**What to do**: Draft subsections following Vietnamese narrative style
**Duration**: 1 week per subsection (7 weeks per chapter)
**Output**: 800-1200 word files in pure Vietnamese

**Critical writing rules**:
- Pure Vietnamese (no English mixing)
- Long narrative paragraphs
- Story-driven openings (NOT time-based)
- Statistics woven into narrative
- Reference style from blockchain-ico example

### Phase 3: Review
**What to do**: Verify sources, check language quality, ensure actionability
**Duration**: 1 week per chapter
**Output**: Polished, publication-ready subsections

## Common Questions

### Q: How strict are the Vietnamese language requirements?
**A**: Very strict. NO mixing English and Vietnamese in the same content. This is non-negotiable.

### Q: What if I can't find specific Vietnamese data?
**A**: Use international data but add Vietnamese context through interviews and local case studies.

### Q: How detailed should case studies be?
**A**: Very detailed. Include real names (or pseudonyms with permission), ages, specific outcomes, timelines. See reference chapter for examples.

### Q: What's the priority between research and writing?
**A**: Research first. Never write without proper research backing. Quality over speed.

### Q: How do I handle controversial claims?
**A**: Support with multiple credible sources, present counterarguments, be transparent about limitations.

## Writing Quality Checklist

Before considering any subsection complete, verify:

✅ **Language**: Pure Vietnamese, no English mixing
✅ **Style**: Long narrative paragraphs (150-300 words)
✅ **Opening**: Story-driven, NOT time-based pattern
✅ **Evidence**: All claims backed by credible sources
✅ **Case studies**: Detailed with specific metrics
✅ **Tone**: Conversational yet authoritative
✅ **Flow**: Smooth transitions between paragraphs
✅ **Practical**: Includes actionable insights
✅ **Balanced**: Presents multiple perspectives
✅ **Accessible**: 10th grader can understand

## When You Get Stuck

### Research Issues
- **Can't find data**: Try alternative search terms, contact researchers directly, use proxy data
- **Paywall sources**: Use Sci-Hub (legally gray), contact authors, use university library access
- **Conflicting data**: Present both, explain discrepancy, focus on most credible source

### Writing Issues
- **Writer's block**: Review reference chapter, outline subsection, start with easiest section
- **Too academic**: Read reference chapter again, imagine explaining to friend
- **Can't weave statistics**: Put data in story format (see reference chapter examples)

### Time Management
- **Falling behind**: Prioritize chapters, get help with research, focus on quality over quantity
- **Overwhelmed**: Focus on one subsection at a time, break into smaller tasks
- **Burnout**: Take breaks, this is 15-month project not sprint

---

## Success Indicators

### You're on track if:
- Research is thorough and well-documented
- Writing matches reference style consistently
- Vietnamese parents reading drafts say "This speaks to me"
- Every claim has credible source
- Practical guidance is specific and actionable
- Progress is steady even if not fast

### Warning signs to address:
- Writing feels academic or formal (wrong tone)
- Sources are weak or missing
- Case studies are vague or generic
- No Vietnamese context
- Can't explain "what should reader do"
- Rushing through research to start writing

## Final Reminder

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.**

The goal is a high-quality, research-backed book that genuinely helps Vietnamese parents make informed decisions about their children's education. Quality and accuracy matter more than speed.

**Core principles**:
1. Research before writing
2. Story-driven narrative
3. Evidence-backed claims
4. Practical guidance
5. Vietnamese context
6. Honest about limitations
7. Accessible language

**If unsure about anything, refer back to**:
- Book plan for structure
- Copilot instructions for writing style
- Reference chapter for tone and flow
- Task files for specific requirements
