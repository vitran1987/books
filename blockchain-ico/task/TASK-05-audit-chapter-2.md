## 📊 DETAILED STEPS

### Step 1: Create Content Inventory (1 hour)

For each file, document in Excel:

- Word count
- Main concepts covered
- Case studies mentioned
- Duplicate stories (compare with overview + Chapter 1)
- Unique content worth preserving

### Step 2: Analyze Duplication Patterns (45 min)

Identify stories told multiple times:

- Bitcoin Pizza Day (likely in overview + file 02)
- Binance Coin burn mechanism (file 03 + file 05?)
- Uniswap liquidity mining (file 05 + file 06?)
- YFI fair launch (file 04 + case studies?)

For each duplicate:

- Where does it appear?
- Which version has most detail?
- What is the PRIMARY concept it illustrates?

### Step 3: Assign Primary Homes (45 min)

Decide which file gets the DETAILED version:

- Bitcoin Pizza: File 02 (demonstrates token as medium of exchange)
- Binance Coin: File 03 (supply design - burn mechanism)
- Uniswap: File 05 (incentive mechanisms - liquidity mining)
- YFI: File 04 (distribution - fair launch)

Other files will REFERENCE these with cross-refs, not repeat full story.

### Step 4: Create Reorganization Plan (30 min)

Outline for TASK-06 through TASK-10:

- Which files to merge
- Which case studies to keep/remove
- Target word counts per file
- Cross-reference strategy

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Complete inventory in Excel (8 files analyzed)
- [ ] Duplicate analysis identifies all repeated stories
- [ ] Primary home assigned for each case study
- [ ] Reorganization plan ready for execution
- [ ] Estimated 40-50% content reduction identified
- [ ] Chapter 2 target: ~15,000 words (from current 30,000)

## ⏱️ TIME BREAKDOWN

- Content inventory: 60 min
- Duplication analysis: 45 min
- Assign primary homes: 45 min
- Create reorg plan: 30 min
- **Total:** 3 hours

## 📝 NOTES

**Expected duplicates from overview:**

- Bitcoin Pizza Day story
- Ethereum gas mechanics
- Binance Coin tokenomics
- Bitcoin halving schedule

These appear in overview AND Chapter 2 - keep detailed version in Ch2, make overview brief.
