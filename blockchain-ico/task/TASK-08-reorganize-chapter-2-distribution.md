# 2.3 Các Phương Thức Phân Phối Token

## 2.3.1 ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
**Brief:** Covered in Chapter 1
- Cross-ref to 1.2 for Ethereum ICO details
- Mention evolution to IEO/IDO (Chapter 3)

## 2.3.2 Fair Launch (Khởi Động Công Bằng)
**Primary Example: Yearn Finance (YFI) - 2020**
[FULL DETAIL - this is THE primary home]
- NO pre-mine, NO VC allocation
- 100% distributed to liquidity providers
- Andre Cronje's philosophy: "valueless token"
- Total supply: 30,000 YFI (later increased to 36,666)
- Distribution: 9-day farming period (July 2020)
- Business outcome: $1.5B+ TVL at peak
- Community-driven governance from day 1
- Lesson: Fair distribution → strong community alignment

## 2.3.3 Airdrop
**Example: Uniswap (UNI) - September 2020**
- 400 UNI per eligible address
- Retroactive reward for early users
- Cross-ref to file 05 for governance mechanics

## 2.3.4 Vesting Schedules
**Example: Token allocation structure**
- Team: 15% vested over 2-4 years
- Investors: 20% with 1-year cliff
- Community: 65% various mechanisms
- Business logic: Prevent dump, align incentives

## 2.3.5 Liquidity Mining
**Brief:** Detailed in file 05 (incentives)
- Uniswap/Compound models
- Cross-reference to incentive mechanisms
```
