```markdown
# Chương 3: Sự Tiến Hóa của Fundraising: IEO, IDO, Launchpads

## 3.1 IEO - Bước Tiến Từ ICO

### 3.1.1 Tại Sao ICO Không Bền Vững?
[Cross-ref Chapter 1: ICO scams, lack of vetting]
- 2017-2018: $6.9B raised, but 80%+ projects failed
- No investor protection
- Regulatory crackdowns (SEC)

### 3.1.2 IEO Là Gì?
- Definition: Exchange-hosted token sale
- Exchange vets project before listing
- Direct trading after sale
- KYC/AML compliance built-in

### 3.1.3 Binance Launchpad: Case Study
**Primary Example:**
- Launched: January 2019
- First project: BitTorrent (BTT)
  - Raised: $7.2M in 18 minutes
  - Price: $0.00012 per BTT
  - ROI: [research current data]
- Notable projects: Polygon (MATIC), Axie Infinity (AXS)
- Selection criteria: team, tech, market fit
- BNB requirement: hold BNB to participate

### 3.1.4 Business Model
**For Exchanges:**
- Listing fees from projects
- Trading volume from new token
- User acquisition (BNB holding requirement)
- Reputation as "gatekeeper"

**For Projects:**
- Credibility from exchange vetting
- Immediate liquidity
- Marketing exposure
- Cost: listing fees, token allocation

### 3.1.5 Limitations
- Centralization risk
- High competition for slots
- Exchange favoritism concerns
- Still regulatory uncertainty in some regions
```

### Step 3: Add Comparisons (30 min)
Table: ICO vs IEO
| Factor | ICO | IEO |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Vetting | None | Exchange review |
| Liquidity | Delayed | Immediate |
| Regulation | Unclear | Exchange compliance |
| Success Rate | ~20% | ~60% |
| Cost to Project | Lower | Higher (listing fees) |

### Step 4: Transition to IDO (15 min)
- Set up next section: "But IEO still centralized..."
- Preview: IDO as decentralized alternative
