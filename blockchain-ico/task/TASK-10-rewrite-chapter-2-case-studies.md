# TASK 10: Rewrite Ch2 Case Studies (4 Projects Only)

**Status:** 🔴 Not Started
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Phase:** 2 - Chapter 2 Token Economics (FINAL TASK)
**Dependencies:** TASK-06 through TASK-09 (all files reorganized)

---

## 📋 OBJECTIVES

1. **Consolidate file 07** (case studies) into 4 comprehensive examples
2. **Each case study demonstrates MULTIPLE concepts** from Chapter 2
3. **Remove stories already told** in files 01-04
4. **Add business outcomes and lessons** for each case
5. **Complete Chapter 2** with actionable insights

## 📂 INPUT/OUTPUT FILES

**INPUT:**
- `chapter-02\07-nghien-cuu-truong-hop.md` (existing case studies)
- All reorganized Chapter 2 files (01-04)
- `TASK-05-chapter-2-inventory.xlsx`

**OUTPUT:**
- `chapter-02\05-integrated-case-studies.md` (~4,500 words)
- Delete old file 08 (future trends → moved to Chapter 10)

## 📊 DETAILED STEPS

### Step 1: Select 4 Case Studies (30 min)
Choose projects NOT already detailed in files 01-04:
- **Avoid:** Bitcoin Pizza Day (file 01), BNB (file 02), YFI (file 03), Uniswap (file 04)
- **Select 4 new examples** that demonstrate integrated token economics

Recommended:
1. **MakerDAO (MKR + DAI)** - dual token model
2. **Curve Finance (CRV)** - vote-escrowed tokenomics
3. **Axie Infinity (AXS + SLP)** - gaming economy (cautionary tale)
4. **Solana (SOL)** - high-performance blockchain tokenomics

### Step 2: Write Comprehensive Case Studies (2.5 hours)
For EACH project (~1,000 words each):

```markdown
## 2.5.1 MakerDAO: Dual-Token Stability System

### Business Model
[What problem does it solve?]

### Token Economics Design
- Token types: MKR (governance) + DAI (stablecoin)
- Supply design: MKR burns from fees, DAI algorithmically pegged
- Distribution: MKR sold in private sale + ICO, DAI generated by users
- Incentives: MKR holders govern, earn fees, absorb losses
- Value capture: Protocol fees → MKR buyback/burn

### Business Outcomes
- TVL: $8B+ (2024)
- DAI supply: 5B+ stablecoins
- Survived Black Thursday (March 2020)

### Lessons Learned
- Dual tokens can create sustainable value capture
- Governance token must have real utility (MKR absorbs debt)
- Stablecoin mechanism requires over-collateralization

### Cross-References
- Chapter 4: Regulatory classification of MKR vs DAI
- Chapter 6: DAO governance mechanisms
- Chapter 8: Stablecoin design (detailed in Terra comparison)
```

Repeat structure for Curve, Axie Infinity, Solana.

### Step 3: Connect to Chapter Themes (45 min)
For each case study, explicitly reference:
- Which token type (from file 01)
- Supply mechanism used (from file 02)
- Distribution method (from file 03)
- Incentive structure (from file 04)

Create a summary table:
| Project | Token Type | Supply Model | Distribution | Key Incentive |
|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| MakerDAO | Governance + Stable | Burn + Algorithmic | Private Sale | Fee sharing |
| Curve | Governance | Inflationary (declining) | Liquidity mining | Vote-escrowed lock |
| Axie | Dual (utility+governance) | Inflationary (uncapped) | Play-to-earn | Gaming rewards |
| Solana | Platform | Inflationary (declining to 1.5%) | ICO + vesting | Staking rewards |

### Step 4: Add Lessons & Transitions (15 min)
- What worked?
- What failed?
- Transition to Chapter 3 (evolution of fundraising)

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] File `05-integrated-case-studies.md` created (~4,500 words)

## ⏱️ TIME BREAKDOWN
- Select projects: 30 min
- Write 4 case studies: 150 min (2.5 hours)
- Connect to themes: 45 min
- Add lessons: 15 min
- **Total:** 4 hours

## 📝 NOTES
