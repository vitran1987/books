## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies **major duplicate stories** across Chapter 2 files and recommends primary homes for each narrative. The chapter contains approximately **163,000 words** with significant story overlap - the same case studies appear in 3-6 different files, often with varying levels of detail.

**Key Finding:** Most duplication occurs with **foundational stories** (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Terra/Luna) that are used to illustrate multiple concepts across different files. File 06 contains the most comprehensive versions of these stories as detailed case studies.

## Duplication Patterns Analysis

### Pattern 1: Foundation Stories in Multiple Contexts
**Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, Terra/Luna

These stories are used to illustrate different concepts:
- Bitcoin illustrates: medium of exchange (File 01), supply design (File 02), success pattern (File 06)
- Ethereum illustrates: multi-utility (File 01), supply evolution (File 02), value accrual (File 05), platform success (File 06)

**Strategy:** Keep ONE comprehensive version in File 06, use brief cross-references elsewhere

### Pattern 2: Mechanism Overlap
**Examples:** Curve ve-tokenomics, Uniswap fee switch

These mechanisms are discussed in both their technical implementation (Files 04/05) and as case studies (File 06).

**Strategy:** Keep technical discussion in mechanism files (04/05), keep full business story in File 06

### Pattern 3: Failure Stories as Warnings
**Examples:** Terra/Luna, Axie Infinity, OneCoin, SQUID

Failure stories appear in multiple files as "what NOT to do" warnings.

**Strategy:** Brief mention (50-100 words) in mechanism files with cross-reference to detailed failure analysis in File 06

---

## Cross-Reference Format Recommendation

When condensing duplicate stories, use this format:

```markdown
**[Token Name]** là một ví dụ điển hình về [concept being illustrated]. [1-2 sentence key point]. 

→ *Xem phân tích chi tiết về [Token Name] tại [File number - File name], phần [section name].*
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Terra/Luna** là ví dụ cảnh báo về stablecoin thuật toán không có tài sản thế chấp. Tháng 5/2022, hệ sinh thái $40 tỷ sụp đổ hoàn toàn trong vòng 72 giờ do death spiral.

→ *Xem phân tích chi tiết về Terra/Luna tại File 06 - Nghiên cứu điển hình, phần "Thất bại: Terra/Luna".*
```

## Summary Statistics

| Category | Current Words | After Deduplication | Savings |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Major duplicate stories | ~45,000 | ~15,000 | 30,000 words |
| Unique content | ~118,000 | TBD (further reduction needed) | TBD |
| **TOTAL** | **~163,000** | **Target: ~15,000** | **~148,000 words needed** |

**Status:** Deduplication alone saves ~30,000 words (18% of total). Additional 70% reduction needed through:
- Removing less impactful examples
- Condensing explanations
- Merging similar subsections
- Strategic file consolidation

1. ✅ **Completed:** Identified major duplicates
2. ✅ **Completed:** Assigned primary homes
3. **Next:** Create reorganization plan with specific file merge/reduction strategies
4. **Next:** Define target word count per file after reorganization
