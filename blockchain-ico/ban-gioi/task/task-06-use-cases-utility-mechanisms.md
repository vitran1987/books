5. **Higher value attracts more users** (growth)
6. **More users = More content** (network effects)
7. **Better content = Better platform** (quality)
8. **Better platform = More students** (cycle continues)

**Multiple Revenue Sinks:**
- Premium subscriptions
- NFT minting (burned)
- Marketplace fees (50% burned)
- Staking (locks supply)

**Why This Works:**

3. Add layers (teach, premium, NFT, staking)
4. Monitor metrics
5. Adjust based on data
6. Community feedback loop
