# TASK 06: VIẾT CHƯƠNG 6 - USE CASES & UTILITY (V2)

**Ngày tạo:** 22/11/2025
**Ưu tiên:** Cao Nhất (Critical)
**Thời gian:** 8-10 ngày
**FILE:** `blockchain-ico\ban-gioi\internal-book-v2\chuong-06-use-cases.md`

## MỤC TIÊU
Major revisions (~65% change), 10,000 từ (V1: 9,200) - Most detailed chapter
- REALISTIC earning projections
- Platform revenue vs Token economy separation
- Dynamic burn mechanisms
- Advisory voting (not binding DAO)

## CẤU TRÚC

### 1. Learn-to-Earn (REALISTIC) (2,000 từ)
**V1 (Unrealistic):**
- 85 BG/day = 2,550 BG/month = $127.50 = 3.2M VND

**V2 (Realistic):**
- 30 BG/day = 900 BG/month = $45 = 1.125M VND
- Rationale: Bổ sung thu nhập, not replacement
- Comparable to part-time online work VN (500K-1.5M VND/month)

**Halving impact:**
- Phase 1: 30 BG/day × $0.05 = $1.50/day
- Phase 3: 10 BG/day × $0.20 = $2.00/day (better USD despite fewer tokens)

### 2. Teach-to-Earn (REALISTIC) (2,000 từ)
**V1 (Unrealistic):**
- 705,000 BG in 6 months = $70,500 = 1.76B VND (phi thực tế)

**V2 (Realistic):**
- Quality course → 200 students @ 1,000 BG
- Revenue: 200K BG, 70/30 split = 140K BG to teacher
- 140K × $0.10 = $14,000 = 350M VND / 6 months
- Monthly: ~58M VND (competitive educator salary)
- Top 1%: 100-150M VND/month (exceptional content)

**Case studies:**
- Udemy top instructors: $50K-200K/year
- Coursera partners: Revenue share models
- Vietnamese tutoring market rates

### 3. Platform Revenue (Fiat Only) (1,500 từ)
**CRITICAL SEPARATION:**

**Platform receives (100% fiat):**
- Premium subs: $5/month in VND
- Enterprise licenses: Schools pay annual VND
- Advertising: Brands pay VND
- ZERO BG tokens to platform

**BG flow (platform never touches):**
- Users earn → User wallets
- Users spend → 50-90% burn, 10-50% to provider
- Platform facilitates only

**Example workflow diagram**

### 4. Premium Subscriptions (1,200 từ)
- Pricing: $5/month = 125K VND
- Features: Ad-free, unlimited courses, priority support
- Users can pay VND OR pay BG (100% burned if BG)
- Conversion incentives

### 5. NFT Certificates (1,000 từ)
- Course completion NFTs
- Professional certificates
- 100% BG payment → 100% burned
- Verifiable on-chain credentials

### 6. Governance (Advisory Only) (1,500 từ)
**V1: Binding DAO votes**
**V2: Advisory input only**

**veBG staking for feature voting:**
- Users stake BG → get veBG (1:1 for 1-year lock)
- veBG = voting power for FEATURE PRIORITIZATION
- Final decisions: Founder/Core team

**Quadratic voting:**
- Voting_Power = sqrt(veBG)
- Wallet cap: 100K veBG max count
- Anti-whale protection

**Decision framework:**
```
Community proposes → Team reviews → 
  If aligns: Implement
  If conflicts: Public explanation → Re-propose
```

**Transparency:**
- Monthly governance reports
- Quarterly founder AMAs
- Public roadmap with community input indicators

**Case studies:**
- Lido: LDO for treasury, core team controls protocol
- Uniswap: Community votes, Labs final decision on v4
- Aave: Guardian veto rights in emergencies

### 7. Burn Transparency Dashboard (800 từ)
- Real-time burn stats
- Current price tier
- Historical burn amounts
- Supply chart (mint vs burn)
