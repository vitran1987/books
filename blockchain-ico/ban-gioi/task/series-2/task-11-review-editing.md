## REVIEW PHASES

### Phase 1: Structural Review (3 days)

**1.1 Overall Structure Validation**

Check that all 9 chapters follow the Series 2 framework:

**Chapter Structure Consistency:**
- [ ] Chapter 1: Governance Model (4,500-5,500 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 2: Single-Token Model (3,500-4,500 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 3: Flexible Supply (4,000-5,000 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 4: Market-Driven Rewards (5,000-6,000 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 5: Realistic Projections (4,000-5,000 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 6: Platform Token Holdings (3,500-4,000 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 7: Dynamic Burn (4,500-5,500 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 8: Anti-Whale (5,000-6,000 words) ✓
- [ ] Chapter 9: Vietnam Tax (12,000-13,000 words) ✓

**Total: 46,000-54,500 words** (Target: ~50,000 words)

**1.2 3-Section Template Compliance**

For each chapter 1-8, verify structure:

**Section 1: Series 1 Recap (10%)**
- [ ] Brief summary of original approach (max 2 paragraphs)
- [ ] No detailed explanations (just reminder)
- [ ] Links to Series 1 chapters for details
- [ ] Clear transition: "Trong Series 1, chúng ta đã thảo luận... Nhưng giờ đây..."

**Section 2: The Improvement (70%)**
- [ ] Detailed explanation of new approach
- [ ] WHY we changed (business + technical reasons)
- [ ] HOW it works differently
- [ ] Case studies supporting the change
- [ ] Implementation details
- [ ] Verified data and statistics

**Section 3: Comparison & Trade-offs (20%)**
- [ ] Direct comparison table (Old vs New)
- [ ] Benefits of new approach
- [ ] Disadvantages/risks of new approach (honest assessment)
- [ ] When new approach works best
- [ ] Recommendation with nuance

**Special: Chapter 9 (Tax)**
- [ ] Completely new content (no Series 1 recap needed)
- [ ] 8-section structure followed
- [ ] Legal accuracy verified
- [ ] Templates included and functional

**1.3 No Content Repetition Check**

Critical validation - ensure Series 2 does NOT repeat Series 1:

**Run comparison check:**
1. Extract key paragraphs from each Series 2 chapter
2. Compare with corresponding Series 1 chapters
3. Flag any sections with >30% similarity
4. Rewrite flagged sections to focus on improvements only

**Allowed overlap:**
- Brief recap sentences in Section 1 of each chapter
- Key terms/definitions (if absolutely necessary)
- Case study names (but NOT full case study text)

**Not allowed:**
- Copy-pasting entire paragraphs from Series 1
- Re-explaining concepts already covered in Series 1
- Detailed background that readers should already know

**Fix:** If overlap found, replace with:
- "Như đã thảo luận chi tiết trong Series 1, Chương X..."
- Link/reference to Series 1
- Jump straight to the improvement

### Phase 2: Content Quality Review (4 days)

**2.1 Fact-Checking (2 days)**

Verify all factual claims with sources:

**Crypto Projects Cited:**

- [ ] Lido voting model (dates, mechanisms)
- [ ] Aave SafetyModule (technical details)
- [ ] Terra/Luna collapse timeline (dates, amounts)
- [ ] Shiba Inu burn stats (verified burn amounts)
- [ ] Bitcoin halving history (dates, block numbers)
- [ ] Ethereum EIP-1559 impact (burn data)

- [ ] Legal status of crypto (current, not outdated)

**Fix:** Any unsupported claim must be:
- Sourced with credible reference, OR
- Labeled as estimate/projection with reasoning, OR

**2.2 Case Study Quality (1 day)**

Verify each case study meets standards:

**Requirements for each case study:**
- [ ] Real project/company (not hypothetical)
- [ ] Specific dates and timeframes
- [ ] Concrete numbers (token prices, user counts, revenue, etc.)
- [ ] Business outcome stated (success/failure metrics)
- [ ] Source cited (company blog, verified news, blockchain data)

**Minimum 2-3 case studies per chapter** (except Ch 9 which has templates instead)

**Quality levels:**
- **Excellent:** Multiple verified sources, specific numbers, clear outcome
- **Good:** One source, some numbers, general outcome
- **Poor:** Hypothetical or vague claims → REWRITE

**2.3 Writing Style Consistency (1 day)**

Check all chapters follow the writing guidelines:

**Narrative Flow:**
- [ ] Long paragraphs with story-based writing (not bullet lists)
- [ ] Smooth transitions between sections
- [ ] Engaging openings (NO "Vào ngày X tháng Y..." patterns)
- [ ] Conversational tone (friendly, accessible)
- [ ] Technical + Business balance (lead with business value)

**Opening Pattern Violations:**
Check first paragraph of each chapter and major section:
- [ ] None start with time-based formulaic openings
- [ ] All use varied, engaging hooks (see CRITICAL opening rules)
- [ ] Emphasize character/action/drama, not dates

**Paragraph Length:**
- [ ] Most paragraphs 100-200 words
- [ ] No single-sentence "paragraphs" (except for emphasis)
- [ ] Ideas fully developed, not fragmented

**Voice:**
- [ ] Active voice (>90% of sentences)

- [ ] No jargon without explanation

---

### Phase 3: Cross-Reference & Consistency (3 days)

**3.1 Internal Consistency - Series 2**

Check consistency across all chapters of Series 2:

**Terminology:**
- [ ] "BG token" used consistently (not "BG coin" or "BGS")
- [ ] "Advisory voting" (not "consultative" or "non-binding" interchangeably)
- [ ] "Flexible supply" (not "elastic" or "variable" randomly)
- [ ] "Market-driven halving" (not "dynamic" or "adaptive" halving)

**Numbers Consistency:**
- [ ] Token price examples (50 VND used consistently)
- [ ] User base projections (align across chapters)
- [ ] Burn rate percentages (50-90% dynamic, not conflicting)
- [ ] Anti-whale thresholds (same numbers in Ch 8 and other refs)

**Tone Consistency:**
- [ ] Same formality level across chapters
- [ ] Same perspective (addressing readers as students/teachers/investors)
- [ ] Same balance of technical depth

**3.2 Series 1 vs Series 2 Coherence**

Ensure Series 2 doesn't contradict Series 1:

**Run contradiction check:**
- [ ] Series 1 said "fixed supply" → Series 2 says "flexible" (GOOD, explicit improvement)
- [ ] Series 1 said "DAO governance" → Series 2 says "advisory voting" (GOOD, explained as refinement)
- [ ] Any statements that directly conflict? → Flag and resolve

**Resolution:**
If contradictions found, options:
1. **Intended improvement:** Explicitly state "We've refined this from Series 1 because..."
2. **Unintended error:** Fix to align with Series 1
3. **Context difference:** Clarify when each approach applies

**3.3 Visual & Diagram Consistency**

Check all diagrams and tables:

**Diagrams:**
- [ ] Governance model flowchart (Ch 1)
- [ ] Token flow diagram (Ch 2)
- [ ] Supply adjustment mechanism (Ch 3)
- [ ] Halving schedule comparison (Ch 4)
- [ ] Revenue projection chart (Ch 5)
- [ ] Platform token holdings (Ch 6)
- [ ] Burn rate curve (Ch 7)
- [ ] Anti-whale fee structure (Ch 8)
- [ ] Tax calculation flowchart (Ch 9)

**Visual standards:**
- [ ] Same color scheme across diagrams
- [ ] Same font (clear, readable)
- [ ] Labeled axes and components
- [ ] High resolution (300 DPI for print)
- [ ] Accessible (colorblind-friendly)

**Tables:**
- [ ] Consistent formatting (borders, alignment)
- [ ] Headers bold and clear
- [ ] Numbers aligned right, text aligned left
- [ ] Sources cited below table

**Sentence structure:**
- [ ] No run-on sentences (>40 words → split)
- [ ] Varied sentence lengths (avoid monotony)
- [ ] Clear antecedents for pronouns

**4.2 Readability Enhancement**

Improve flow and clarity:

- [ ] Define technical terms on first use (with Vietnamese equivalent)

**Engagement:**
- [ ] Vary sentence openings (not all start with subject)
- [ ] Use rhetorical questions sparingly for emphasis
- [ ] Include occasional humor or relatable analogies (where appropriate)

**4.3 Formatting Consistency**

Ensure markdown formatting is consistent:

**Headings:**
- [ ] H1: Chapter titles only (`#`)
- [ ] H2: Major sections (`##`)
- [ ] H3: Subsections (`###`)
- [ ] H4: Sub-subsections (`####`)
- [ ] No skipping levels (H1 → H3 without H2)

**Lists:**
- [ ] Bullet points for unordered lists
- [ ] Numbers for sequential steps
- [ ] Consistent indentation for nested lists

**Code blocks:**
- [ ] Use ``` for multi-line code/examples
- [ ] Use ` for inline code/token names

**Emphasis:**
- [ ] Bold for key terms first use (`**term**`)
- [ ] Italics for emphasis or foreign words (`*word*`)
- [ ] Consistent usage (don't randomly bold)

**Tables:**
