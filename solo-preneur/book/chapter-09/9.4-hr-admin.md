# 9.4 HR và Administration Tự Động: AI Executive Assistant cho Solo Entrepreneur

Thùy Trang ngồi trong quán cà phê ở quận 1, laptop mở sẵn, frantically typing responses cho 15 emails from potential freelancers muốn join team "English Boost" - startup dạy tiếng Anh conversation cho professionals. Trong 2 tháng qua, platform đã grow từ 50 lên 800 students, forcing Trang phải rapidly scale team từ solo founder thành organization với 12 freelance teachers, 3 content creators, 2 marketing assistants, và 1 customer success specialist.
