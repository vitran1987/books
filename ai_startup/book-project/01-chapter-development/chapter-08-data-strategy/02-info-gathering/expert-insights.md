## Data Strategy Consultants and Executives

### Data Competitive Advantage Development Methodologies

#### Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Data Officer, Databricks
**Background**: Former McKinsey partner, 15+ years in data strategy consulting  
**Key Insights on Data Moats:**

*"The most sustainable data advantages come from network effects and proprietary data collection, not just data volume. Companies like Waze succeeded because every user improved the product for everyone else. AI startups should focus on creating data flywheels where usage generates better data, which improves the product, which attracts more users."*

**Recommended Framework:**
1. **Data Network Effects**: Design products where user data improves experience for all users
2. **Proprietary Collection**: Develop unique data collection capabilities competitors can't replicate
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on high-quality, labeled data rather than raw volume
