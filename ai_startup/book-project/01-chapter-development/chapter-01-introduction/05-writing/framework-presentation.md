```
AI Opportunity Assessment Framework
├── Market Readiness (25% weight)
├── Technology Feasibility (25% weight)
├── Competitive Positioning (25% weight)
└── Resource Requirements (25% weight)
```

#### Detailed Criteria Presentation

**Market Readiness Assessment (25% weight)**

*Presented as simple checklist format:*

□ **Customer Pain Point Intensity** (0-10 scale)
  - 8-10: Critical business problem requiring immediate solution
  - 6-7: Important problem with clear value proposition
  - 4-5: Nice-to-have improvement with moderate value
  - 0-3: Marginal problem with unclear value

□ **Market Size and Growth** (0-10 scale)
  - 8-10: $1B+ addressable market with >25% growth
  - 6-7: $100M-1B market with >15% growth
  - 4-5: $10M-100M market with >10% growth
  - 0-3: <$10M market or declining growth

□ **Customer Willingness to Pay** (0-10 scale)
  - 8-10: Customers actively seeking solutions and budget allocated
  - 6-7: Clear value recognition with procurement process
  - 4-5: Interest expressed but budget unclear
  - 0-3: Limited interest or budget constraints

*Calculation*: Market Readiness Score = (Pain Point × 0.4) + (Market Size × 0.4) + (Willingness to Pay × 0.2)

#### Implementation Guidance

**Step-by-Step Application Process**:

1. **Gather Market Intelligence**
   - Conduct customer interviews (minimum 10 potential customers)
   - Research market size and growth data
   - Analyze competitive landscape and pricing
   - Assess customer budget allocation and decision-making processes

2. **Score Each Criterion**
   - Use 0-10 scale for objective assessment
   - Document reasoning and evidence for each score
   - Seek input from advisors and industry experts
   - Cross-validate scores with multiple data sources

3. **Calculate Overall Score**
   - Apply weighting formula for each category
   - Calculate total opportunity score (0-10 scale)
   - Compare against decision thresholds
   - Document assumptions and risk factors

4. **Make Go/No-Go Decision**
   - 8.0-10.0: Excellent opportunity - Proceed with confidence
   - 6.0-7.9: Good opportunity - Proceed with careful planning
   - 4.0-5.9: Marginal opportunity - Requires significant improvement
   - 0.0-3.9: Poor opportunity - Do not proceed without major changes

#### Real-World Application Example

**Example: Healthcare AI Diagnostic Tool**

*Market Readiness Assessment*:
- Pain Point Intensity: 9 (Critical need for faster, more accurate diagnosis)
- Market Size: 8 ($50B diagnostic market, 15% growth)
- Willingness to Pay: 7 (Hospitals have budget, procurement process exists)
- Market Readiness Score: (9 × 0.4) + (8 × 0.4) + (7 × 0.2) = 8.2

*Technology Feasibility Assessment*:
- AI Technology Maturity: 8 (Proven computer vision capabilities)
- Data Availability: 7 (Medical images available, some privacy constraints)
- Technical Complexity: 6 (Moderate complexity, regulatory requirements)
- Technology Feasibility Score: (8 × 0.4) + (7 × 0.3) + (6 × 0.3) = 7.3

*Overall Assessment*: Strong opportunity with high market readiness and good technology feasibility
