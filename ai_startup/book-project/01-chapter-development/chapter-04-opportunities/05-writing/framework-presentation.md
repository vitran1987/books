## 🔍 Framework 1: AI Opportunity Identification Framework

### Narrative Introduction Strategy

**Story-Based Framework Introduction**
The AI Opportunity Identification Framework emerges directly from the systematic approach that enabled Jasper AI's founders to transform a personal frustration into a $1.5 billion venture within three years. When Dave Rogenmoser found himself drowning in content creation demands at his marketing agency in early 2021, he didn't simply assume his experience represented a universal problem. Instead, he and his co-founders developed a systematic methodology for evaluating whether their personal pain point represented a genuine market opportunity worthy of venture development. Their three-week process of market landscape mapping, customer problem identification, and technology-market fit assessment became the foundation for a replicable framework that entrepreneurs can apply to any potential AI opportunity.

**Framework Components Presentation Within Story Context**

**Week 1: Market Landscape Mapping (Jasper AI Example)**
