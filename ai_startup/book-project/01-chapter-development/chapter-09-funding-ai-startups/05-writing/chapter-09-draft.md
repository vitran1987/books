# Chapter 9: Building Your AI Application Team
## Assembling Customer-Focused AI Organizations

### Introduction: The Customer-Centric Team Building Imperative

In the summer of 2021, Dave Rogenmoser faced one of the most critical decisions in Jasper AI's journey from startup to market leader. As the CEO of the rapidly growing AI-powered content creation platform, he had successfully built a product that customers loved, but he realized that scaling from 10,000 to 100,000+ users would require a fundamentally different approach to team building. Unlike AI platform companies that focus on research teams and technical talent, Jasper AI needed to build customer-obsessed teams that could deliver exceptional user experiences, drive customer success, and scale business operations while maintaining the personal touch that made their early customers advocates.

The challenge was formidable. Traditional AI companies competed for research scientists and ML engineers, but Jasper AI needed a different kind of talent: customer success specialists who understood AI applications, product managers who could translate customer needs into AI features, sales professionals who could explain AI value to business customers, and support teams who could help customers achieve success with AI tools. This required building entirely new recruiting strategies, compensation frameworks, and team cultures optimized for customer value creation rather than technical innovation.

The story of how Jasper AI built their customer-focused team reveals the sophisticated strategies and frameworks that successful AI application companies use to attract, develop, and retain talent optimized for customer success and business growth. Their approach demonstrates that building great AI application teams requires more than just hiring talented individuals—it requires creating compelling customer missions, building cultures that prioritize user value, developing systematic approaches to customer-focused talent identification, and creating environments where customer-obsessed professionals can deliver exceptional results.

Jasper AI's team-building success began with a clear and compelling customer mission that resonated with professionals who wanted to help businesses and creators succeed with AI-powered content creation. Rather than competing solely on compensation or technical prestige, they attracted talent by offering the opportunity to directly impact customer success and business outcomes. They created a customer-centric culture that balanced innovation with execution, enabling team members to experiment with new approaches while maintaining focus on customer value delivery.

The team-building strategies that enabled Jasper AI's success illustrate the evolution of AI application talent management from traditional tech hiring practices to customer-focused approaches that address the unique characteristics of AI application markets. AI application professionals are motivated by different factors than AI researchers, including customer impact, business outcomes, market success, and opportunities for customer relationship building. The companies that understand these motivations and build comprehensive talent strategies around them will have significant advantages in building the teams needed for AI application success.

This chapter provides you with the frameworks, strategies, and tools needed to build world-class AI application teams that can deliver exceptional customer experiences and drive sustainable business growth. You'll learn how to design optimal team structures and roles for customer-focused AI applications, develop comprehensive talent acquisition strategies that attract customer-obsessed professionals, create cultures and environments that enable exceptional customer success teams to thrive, and implement retention and development programs that keep your best customer-facing talent engaged and growing.

The team-building imperative for AI application companies extends beyond simply hiring talented individuals to encompass creating organizational systems and cultures that enable customer success and business growth. The most successful AI application companies understand that their competitive advantage comes not just from individual talent but from their ability to create teams that are obsessed with customer value, where exceptional professionals collaborate effectively to solve customer problems and create experiences that drive business success and customer loyalty.

### AI Application Team Structure and Roles

The design of optimal AI application team structures requires deep understanding of the unique roles, skills, and collaboration patterns that enable successful customer-focused AI development and business growth. Unlike AI platform companies where teams focus on research and technical innovation, AI application teams must integrate customer success specialists, product managers, sales professionals, and support teams in ways that balance innovation with customer value delivery, technical capability with business outcomes, and product development with customer relationship management.

The evolution of team structure at Gong.io provides an exemplary case study of how AI application companies can design and scale team organizations that support both customer success and business growth. Founded in 2015 by Amit Bendov and Eilon Reshef, Gong.io began as a conversation analytics startup but evolved into the leading revenue intelligence platform serving thousands of sales teams worldwide. Their journey from a small startup to a company valued at $7.25 billion demonstrates how thoughtful customer-focused team design can enable rapid scaling while maintaining exceptional customer experience and business growth.

Gong.io's early team structure reflected their initial focus on conversation recording and basic analytics, with a traditional startup composition of founders handling multiple roles and a small team of engineers building the core product. However, as they evolved to become a comprehensive revenue intelligence platform, they recognized the need for specialized customer-focused roles and began systematically building a team structure optimized for customer success, sales growth, and market expansion.

The transformation of Gong.io's team structure illustrates the key principles of effective AI application team design. First, they created clear focus on customer success functions while ensuring strong collaboration between customer-facing teams and product development. Their customer success team focuses on helping sales teams achieve better outcomes with conversation intelligence, driving product adoption, and ensuring customer retention and expansion. Their sales team focuses on acquiring new customers and demonstrating the business value of revenue intelligence.

Second, they invested heavily in customer education and support roles that are unique to AI application companies. These roles bridge the gap between AI capabilities and customer business outcomes, helping sales teams understand and effectively use Gong.io's insights while providing feedback that guides product development. This customer focus has been critical to Gong.io's success in achieving industry-leading customer retention rates and becoming the standard for revenue intelligence.

Third, they created hybrid roles that combine AI understanding with customer expertise, including customer success managers who understand both the technical capabilities of conversation intelligence and the business needs of sales organizations. These roles are essential for translating AI insights into customer business value and sustainable growth.

The AI Application Team Framework that emerges from Gong.io's success and similar companies provides systematic approaches to designing team organizations that optimize for customer success and business growth. The framework begins with Core Customer-Facing Roles that form the foundation of AI application team capability and customer value delivery.

Customer Success Managers represent the customer advocacy engine of AI application teams, responsible for ensuring customers achieve their desired outcomes and maximize value from AI applications. These roles require deep understanding of customer business needs, AI application capabilities, and success metrics. Customer success managers typically have business or technical backgrounds with 3-5 years of customer-facing experience and strong communication and problem-solving skills.

The responsibilities of customer success managers include onboarding new customers and ensuring successful AI application adoption, monitoring customer usage patterns and identifying optimization opportunities, providing ongoing support and guidance to maximize customer value, identifying expansion opportunities and driving customer growth, and collecting customer feedback to guide product development. Success in these roles requires both business acumen and technical understanding, along with exceptional relationship-building and communication skills.

Sales Professionals focus on acquiring new customers and demonstrating the business value of AI applications to prospective buyers. These roles require combination of sales expertise and AI application knowledge, typically requiring 5+ years of B2B sales experience with preference for technology or AI-related sales background. Sales professionals must understand both the technical capabilities of AI applications and the business outcomes they enable.

The responsibilities of sales professionals include identifying and qualifying potential customers for AI applications, conducting product demonstrations and explaining AI value propositions, managing sales processes and closing new customer deals, collaborating with customer success teams to ensure smooth customer transitions, and providing market feedback to guide product strategy and development. Success in these roles requires strong sales skills, business acumen, and the ability to communicate complex AI concepts in business terms.

Product Managers serve as the bridge between customer needs and technical development, responsible for translating customer requirements into product features and ensuring AI applications deliver maximum customer value. These roles require combination of technical understanding and business acumen, typically requiring MBA or equivalent business experience along with technical background in AI applications or related fields.

The responsibilities of product managers include defining AI application product strategy and roadmap based on customer needs, gathering and prioritizing customer requirements and feature requests, coordinating cross-functional teams to deliver customer value, measuring and optimizing AI application performance and customer outcomes, and communicating with stakeholders about AI capabilities and business impact. Success in these roles requires strong analytical skills, customer empathy, and the ability to work effectively with both technical and business teams.

Support and Implementation Specialists provide the technical expertise needed to help customers successfully deploy and optimize AI applications. These roles require technical skills combined with customer service excellence, typically requiring technical degrees with experience in AI applications, customer support, or technical consulting.

As you build your AI application team, remember that success comes from systematic application of customer-focused frameworks combined with continuous learning and adaptation based on customer feedback and business outcomes. The AI application talent landscape continues to evolve rapidly, creating new opportunities and challenges that require strategic thinking and disciplined execution focused on customer value creation. The frameworks and principles outlined in this chapter provide a foundation for team building excellence, but their ultimate value comes from how effectively you apply them to your specific customer needs and adapt them based on your team performance and business results.

### Conclusion: Building Customer-Obsessed AI Application Teams

The journey of building exceptional AI application teams through customer-focused hiring, culture development, and organizational design is challenging but immensely rewarding. By applying systematic team building methodologies, implementing customer-centric approaches that drive business success, developing talent strategies that attract customer-obsessed professionals, and creating environments that enable exceptional customer experiences, you can build AI application teams that not only achieve commercial success but also demonstrate the positive potential of customer-focused AI development and business growth.
