### MANDATORY Story-Based Content Requirements
**CRITICAL: All content must follow these story-based writing standards:**

- Fragmented sections with highlighted subheaders followed by 1-2 sentences
- Lists of examples without detailed context and stories
- Short paragraphs (less than 4-5 sentences) for major concepts

- Comprehensive explanations that include context, examples, and implications
- Smooth transitions between concepts using storytelling techniques

**STORY-BASED WRITING EXAMPLES:**
- GOOD: "OpenAI's journey from non-profit research lab to $150 billion company offers crucial lessons for AI entrepreneurs, but the path wasn't straightforward. In fact, their business model evolution reveals a masterclass in strategic pivoting that every entrepreneur should understand. When OpenAI started in 2015, they had no business model at all. Sam Altman and his co-founders were so focused on the mission of beneficial AI that they structured the organization as a non-profit. They raised $1 billion in pledges from tech luminaries like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman, with the explicit promise that any breakthroughs would be shared freely with the world..."
