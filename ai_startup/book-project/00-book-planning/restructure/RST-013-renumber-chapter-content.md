## 🔄 Renumbering Map

### Chapter Folder Renaming
| Current Name | New Name | Content Focus |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| `chapter-22-financial-management/` | `chapter-17-financial-management/` | Financial Management |

- [ ] Verify RST-012 completion (EdTech chapters removed)
- [ ] Confirm current structure: chapters 1-16, 22-27
- [ ] Document current chapter structure
- [ ] Identify all files requiring reference updates

### Step 2: Systematic Folder Renaming (45 minutes)
- [ ] Rename `chapter-22-financial-management/` → `chapter-17-financial-management/`
- [ ] Rename `chapter-23-legal-framework/` → `chapter-18-legal-framework/`
- [ ] Rename `chapter-24-accounting/` → `chapter-19-accounting/`
- [ ] Rename `chapter-25-marketing-brand-building/` → `chapter-20-marketing-brand-building/`
- [ ] Rename `chapter-26-management/` → `chapter-21-management/`
- [ ] Rename `chapter-27-operations/` → `chapter-22-operations/`

### Step 3: Update Internal References (45 minutes)
- [ ] Update task file headers with new chapter numbers
- [ ] Update cross-chapter references in content files
- [ ] Update dependency references between chapters
- [ ] Update any navigation or index files

### Step 4: Validation and Testing (15 minutes)
- [ ] Verify all folders renamed correctly
- [ ] Check for broken internal links
- [ ] Confirm consecutive numbering (1-22)
- [ ] Test content accessibility

## 📊 Files Requiring Updates

### Task File Headers
Each chapter contains 8 task files that need header updates:
- `01-discovery/` task files
- `02-info-gathering/` task files
- `03-validation/` task files
- `04-consolidation/` task files
- `05-writing/` task files
- `06-review/` task files
- `07-translation/` task files
- `08-translation-revision/` task files

### Cross-Reference Files
- Chapter dependency maps
- Content structure documents
- Navigation files
- Index and table of contents files

## 🚨 Critical Considerations

### During Renumbering
- [ ] Maintain content integrity throughout process
- [ ] Update references immediately after each rename
- [ ] Use systematic approach to prevent confusion
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify no content loss during renaming
- [ ] Confirm all references updated correctly
- [ ] Test chapter navigation and links
- [ ] Validate against project management structure

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Structural Results
- **Chapter Count**: Consecutive 1-22 numbering
- **Content Integrity**: All content preserved and accessible
- **Reference Accuracy**: All internal links functional

### Alignment Achievement
- **Project Management**: Content structure matches task structure
- **Restructuring Plan**: Full implementation in content development
