- `[-]` CANCELLED: Task no longer relevant

#### CRITICAL: Sequential Workflow Dependencies
**MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING:**

**Phase Flow**: Discovery â†’ Information Gathering â†’ Validation â†’ Consolidation â†’ Writing â†’ Review â†’ Translation

**Dependency Rules**:
- Each phase ONLY uses outputs from the immediately preceding phase
- Writing phase ONLY refers to Consolidation phase outputs (NOT Discovery, Information Gathering, or Validation)
- No phase skips or combines inputs from multiple previous phases
- Each expert works exclusively with deliverables from their immediate predecessor

**Example Workflow**:
1. **Discovery Expert** creates research framework â†’ outputs to folder `01-discovery/`
2. **Information Gathering Expert** uses ONLY `01-discovery/` outputs â†’ creates research data â†’ outputs to folder `02-info-gathering/`
3. **Validation Expert** uses ONLY `02-info-gathering/` outputs â†’ creates verified data â†’ outputs to folder `03-validation/`
4. **Consolidation Expert** uses ONLY `03-validation/` outputs â†’ creates strategic analysis â†’ outputs to folder `04-consolidation/`
5. **Writing Expert** uses ONLY `04-consolidation/` outputs â†’ creates chapter draft â†’ outputs to folder `05-writing/`
6. **Review Expert** uses ONLY `05-writing/` outputs â†’ creates final chapter â†’ outputs to folder `06-review/`

**Quality Gate Enforcement**:
- Each expert validates that previous phase outputs meet their input requirements
- No expert begins work until predecessor phase is 100% complete
- Clear deliverable handoff documentation required between phases
- Each phase folder contains complete, self-contained deliverables for next phase
