## WRITING METHODOLOGY

### WRITING STYLE REFERENCE (MANDATORY)

**ALL writers MUST study this reference before starting any chapter:**
**Reference File**: `e:\Books\blockchain-ico\chapter-01\01-lich-su-va-thanh-cong-ico.md`

This file demonstrates the exact writing style required:
- Character-led openings with emotional engagement
- Long narrative paragraphs with continuous flow
- Real examples with verified data (specific numbers, dates, companies)
- Business impact leading technical details
- Conversational, accessible tone throughout

### Content Requirements
- ✅ Long narrative paragraphs (NO bullet lists in main content)
- ✅ Real-life case studies with verified metrics
- ✅ Trusted sources for all claims (cite specific sources)
- ✅ Business + Technical balance (business value first)
- ✅ Conversational, engaging tone (colleague-to-colleague)
- ✅ 5-8 subsections per chapter in separate files
- ✅ EPUB-ready formatting (H1, H2, H3)

### Opening Pattern Rules (CRITICAL)
- ❌ NEVER: Time-based openings ("Vào ngày X tháng Y năm Z...")
- ✅ ALWAYS: Varied, engaging hooks:
  - Character emotion or decision
  - Crisis or extraordinary event
  - Achievement or statistic
  - Question or controversy
  - Action in progress
  
### Examples from Reference File:
**Good Opening**: "J.R. Willett đã từng là một kỹ sư phần mềm bình thường ở Seattle - không có danh tiếng trong giới khởi nghiệp..."

**Data Integration**: "Trong vòng một tháng, từ ngày 31 tháng 7 đến ngày 1 tháng 9 năm 2013, ông đã huy động được 5,120 Bitcoin từ hơn 500 nhà đầu tư..."

**Business Impact**: "Đến năm 2025, mạng Filecoin đã lưu trữ hơn 20 exabytes dữ liệu, phục vụ hàng nghìn khách hàng..."

### Technical Focus
- ✅ High-level methods and strategies
- ✅ Architecture and solution comparison
- ✅ Decision frameworks
- ❌ NOT: Low-level code or configuration

### File Operations
1. Create empty file first
2. Update in 50-line increments
3. Think between increments
4. Never large files at once
